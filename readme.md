AspMvc5Northwind
================

This is an example project demonstrating ASP.NET MVC5, using database-first
design method, using the Northwind database.

Most code is either copied from or heavily inspired by examples/tutorials
available at http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/.

The database for this project was created locally using NorthwindDB.sqlserver.sql
in this directory.


Rough steps to recreate this project
====================================

If for some reason you want to create this project from scratch (rather than
using the included source files), do the following:

- Create a new ASP.NET MVC project
- Add a blank database
- Run NorthwindDB.sqlserver.sql to create the Northwind database
- That's it...
